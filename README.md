# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects

## 1. ANN Practice Project
A neural network project using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify cancer cases based on a dataset (cancer_classification.csv). This project builds a feedforward neural network model to predict the presence or absence of cancer.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras
Dataset: cancer_classification.csv

## 2. CNN-CIFAR10-Classification Project
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 categories of images. This project demonstrates image classification using deep learning with a CNN.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras, TensorFlow
Dataset: CIFAR-10

## 3. CNN-MNIST-Classification Project
Another CNN-based project focusing on handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. This project builds a CNN to recognize digits from 0 to 9.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras, TensorFlow
Dataset: MNIST

## 4. Google Train Model (LSTM for Stock Price Prediction)
This project trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model using Google stock data (GOOG.csv) to predict stock trends based on historical prices.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras, TensorFlow
Dataset: GOOG.csv

## 5. Google Train and Test (RNN for Stock Price Prediction)
An extension of the previous project, using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for both training and testing on Google stock data. This project explores time-series forecasting using an RNN model.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras, TensorFlow
Dataset: GOOG.csv

## 6. House Price Prediction Project
A regression-based project predicting house prices based on features in the dataset. This project utilizes ANN techniques to build a predictive model for real estate pricing.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras
Dataset: Real estate or housing data (modify as needed if you have a specific dataset name)

## 7. TITANIC ANN Project
An ANN-based project that predicts Titanic survival outcomes based on passenger data. This project uses a neural network to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras
Dataset: Titanic dataset

## 8. ANN-Keras Project (Lending Club Loan Prediction)
This project uses an ANN to predict loan approval status based on Lending Clubâ€™s loan data (lending_club_info.csv). The model predicts loan approval probabilities.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras
Dataset: lending_club_info.csv

## 9. DL-CV Assessment (Deep Learning for Image Classification)
An assessment project for image classification using a deep learning model, focusing on custom image data or a specialized dataset for computer vision tasks.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras, OpenCV
Dataset: Image classification dataset

## 10. Keras-Syntax-Basics
A foundational project to get started with Keras, covering the basics of syntax, model building, compilation, and training. This project serves as a tutorial for building neural networks in Keras.

Tech Stack: Python, Keras
